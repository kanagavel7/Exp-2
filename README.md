# Exp - 2 LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

# AIM:

To study the problem statement, SRS document and draw all the UML diagrams of LIbrary Managements.

# SRS (Procedure):

1) Define the system main components and functionalities.
2) Identify actors and usecases for the system.
3) Illustrate the flow of actions for a specific task.
4) Defin the classess and relationships in the system.
5) Group related classess into package illustrate dependencies between the packages.
